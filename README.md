Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh

Dear beloved friends, we are back today with a beneficial plugin for both worlds, insha'Allah.

This plugin is for reading the Holy Quran, browsing it, searching within it, and many more features that I will detail in the upcoming screenshots.

Please try to read from the physical Mus'haf (Quran) whenever possible. I have included a daily reminder for your daily recitation (Wird) and a Friday reminder for Surah Al-Kahf, where you can adjust the timing as you prefer.

"And We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?" (54:17)

The plugin is currently functional only on the latest Python 3.13.5 versions. Once fully completed, it will be compatible with all Python 3 versions.

I have not forgotten our brothers in the Maghreb region who prefer the Warsh recitation. A separate installable IPK file is available for them.

The installation file (IPK) is tested on Python 3.15.5, OpenATV 7.6 image, as shown in the attached files.
